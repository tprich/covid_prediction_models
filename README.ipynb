    "The Federal Department of Health has put together a team of data scientists to help investigate the COVID-19 outbreaks of 2020 and 2021. By comparing both SIR and ARIMA models using national COVID-19 data from the CDC, we want to determine if SIR or ARIMA is a better predictor of new COVID-19 infections.\n",

    "\n",
    "SIR models provide a theoretical framework for the time rates of change of three populations in an outbreak of a contageous disease. The populations in the model are given the shorthand \n",
    "- $S$ for the number of people in the population that are suscptable to getting infected\n",
    "- $I$ for the number of people that are infected\n",
    "- $R$ for the people that are recovered from the disease (and are therefore imune, possibly only temporarily)\n",
    "The three populations exchange members as time goes on as shown in the diagram below. For example, suscepable people become infected. The following directed graph shows the exchanges in the model with $a,~b,~c,$ and $\\alpha$ as arbitary numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "- $a$ is called **transmissability**\n",
    "- $b$ is called **recovery rate**\n",
    "- $c$ is called **deimunization rate**\n",

    "##### 1.2) Simple SIR \n",
    "As a simple example of an SIR model, consider the case where \n",
    "- recovered people never become susceptable, which corresponds to the value $c=0$,\n",
    "- no vaccine exists, so susceptable people never become recovered without first becoming infected, which corresponds to $\\alpha = 0$. \n",
    "- The total population is 1 in units of millions (and, to further simplify, is constant). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"code/images/simple_SIR.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the time rates of change of the three categories are descibed by the non-linear ordinary differential equaiton\n",

    "$bI = 1 \\frac{\\rm person}{\\rm day}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2) Toward realistic $a$\n",
    "##### 2.2.1) Introducing Reproductive Number Through Exponential Models \n",
    "\n",
    "SIR models are improvements upon expontial models in that \n",
    "- exponential models treat the susceptable population as infinitely large, \n",
    "- SIR models take into account that the susceptable population is finite and changes size. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an exponential growth model of disease transmission each infected person, over the duration of their infection, infects some number of susceptable people. This number is called **the reproductive number** of the disease. \n",

    "**If the reproductive number of a disease is less than 1 then the disease will die out.** \n",
    "\n",
    "To make this idea quantitative, let $b$ be the recovery rate (so $1/b$ is the durration of disease) and number $r_0$ be the reproductive number of a disease. \n",
    "The differential below above is then interpreted as \"each day each infected person infects $r_0 b$ other people.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dI}{dt} = r_0 b  I.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called an exponential model because the solutions ($I$ as a function of time $t$) are the exponential functions of the form\n",
    "$$I(t) = I_0(r_0b)^t$$\n",
    "with $I(0)$ the number of infections when $t=0$. \n",
    "Changing base to Euler's number ($e$) the functions are\n",
    "$$I(t) = I_0e^{\\ln(r_0 b)t}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The doubling time for the infection is $t_d$ such that $e^{\\log(r_0 b)t_d}=2 \\Rightarrow t_d = \\ln(2)/\\ln(r_0b).$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2.2) Reproductive number in SIR Models\n",
    "SIR models have a similar feature, the reproductive number, but the value changes in time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in SIR models \n",
    "$$\\frac{dI}{dt} =  aSI - bI$$ \n",
    "The first term is the number of new infections per time. Compare that term to the analagous term in exponential growth models;\n",
    "$$ aSI \\sim r_0bI.$$\n",
    "The dynamics of the two terms are different; the product $aS$ changes in time while $r_0b$ does not change in time. As a result, the exponential model grows exponentially without end, but the SIR models infections peak and then decay to 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, when almost all of the population is susceptable $S\\approx p$, the growth rate of $I$ is exponential. The similarity then takes on the form \n",
    "$$ aPI \\sim r_0bI \\\\\n",
    "\\Leftrightarrow \n",
    "r_0 = p\\frac{a}{b}.$$\n",
    "This is the reproductive number of an SIR model in terms of the transmission rate $a$, recovery rate $b$, and population $p$. \n",
    "The measured value of $r_0$ for COVID is approxinately $2.8$.\n",
    "This demands that the transmission rate of covid be \n",
    "$$a =\\frac{2.8 b}{p}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2.3) Effective Reproductive Rate and Herd Immunity From Another Argument\n",
    "\n",
    "When $S$ changes to below $p$ as the infectionstarts to spread, the reproductive rate becomes an effective reproductive rate\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_{{\\rm eff}} = S\\frac{a}{b}.\n",

    "##### 2.3) Conclusion: Realistic Values of Parameters  $𝑎$ ,  $𝑏$ , and $p$\n",

    "\n",

Using the [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/#) python Library, we fetched the total number of reported COVID-19 cases in all states from Jan 23, 2020 to Dec 29, 2021. We also gathered the total number of vaccinations administered from the day the vaccine was made public. This process can be seen in the notebook titled \"01 data gathering and cleaning.\"\n",

However, for the SIR model, we needed the number of people infected _daily_. In order to get this data, we used the .diff() method on the column titled tot_cases and assigned the values to a I_actual column. We did a .diff(14) to reflect the number of days a person has an active COVID-19 infection.\n",

    "## Conclusions and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "In our comparison of SIR and ARIMA models, SIR consistently overshoots the actual values. Therefore, we recommend that the Federal Department of Health use SIR more to shpw worst case scenarios, and use ARIMA for more accurate predicitions. The downside is that ARIMA's best predictions are short term. \n",
    "\n",
    "A possible reasons why SIR consistently overpredicts is because it does take take into account changes in behavior such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Social distancing\n",
    "- Remote work/school\n",
    "- Masking\n",
    "- Hand washing\n",
    "- Reduced travel\n",
    "- Closure of public places \n",
    "\n",
    "and other COVID-19 related precautions. These precautions very likely prevented the U.S. from reaching the infection numbers predicted by SIR. SIR also does not take into account how far apart populations are. For example, cities in rural parts of the country are less dense and therefore will have slower spread statewide comparitive to cities and states such as New York.\n",
    "\n",
    "SIR also does not account for variants in the virus which have different rates of transmission (R0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, SIR isn't the best for actual predictions. However, it is appropriate for predicting worst case scenarios. Next steps would include testing SIR models on time frames \"medium\" time frames such as 1 week, 1 month etc., and further attempting to adjust the SIR parameters to account for changes in behaviors. \n",
